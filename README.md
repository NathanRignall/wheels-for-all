## Wheels for All

To run the project locally, you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

You will also need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.

Finally you will also need to have the [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.io/docs/guides/cli) installed.

# Running the project locally

Start supabase with ```supabase start```

Initialise the database with ```supabase db reset```

Create an .env.local file in the client root directory and add the following variables:
    
``` 
NEXT_PUBLIC_STAGE=dev
NEXT_PUBLIC_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

Install dependencies with ```npm install```

Build the frontend with ```npm run build```

Start the server with ```npm run start```

As the server is running, you can now visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) from your browser.

To access emails sent by the app, visit [http://localhost:54324](http://localhost:54324) from your browser.
